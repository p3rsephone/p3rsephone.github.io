        <title>Train Social Engineering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my first year of college I’ve had to commute by train twice a week. It’s a 2 hour journey and after finishing all of my “To Read” List and listening to all of the podcasts my phone can hold, I’ve needed something else to occupy my mind.
I resorted to people watch, but instead of watching the passengers I felt drawn to the conductor. Specifically, why he asked certain people for tickets and others he just ignored. See, in Portugal the conductor doesn’t ask for your ticket when you’re boarding the train. He asks for it after the train has left and you’re already on it. I figured he couldn’t possibly memorize every person’s face, so how come some people got asked and others got ignored?
I set myself to answer that same question and made my goal to never be asked for the train ticket again. Here’s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-enter-like-a-ninja&quot;&gt;1. Enter like a ninja&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nicolevanputten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ninja.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sneaky sneaky&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is no way you can avoid being asked for your train ticket if the conductor actually &lt;strong&gt;sees&lt;/strong&gt; you enter the train. So try to enter as far away from him as possible and immediately take a seat. Don’t linger up too long or you will risk him seeing you! Also, if the train is mostly empty you’re out of luck, he probably noticed you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-act-casual&quot;&gt;2. Act casual&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cha0ticneutral.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/act_n_casual_by_owlbeawkward-d8y3nck.png?w=209&amp;amp;h=331&quot; alt=&quot;Lalala&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;he relies on you to make the move of giving him the ticket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, easier said than done, but that’s the actual secret. There are, of course, a couple of tricks you can use, but the whole thing is based off of one thing: the conductor &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t actually know&lt;/strong&gt; if he’s already asked you for the ticket or not. He has thousands of people to deal with on a day to day basis, so he relies on you to make the move of giving him the ticket. So all you have to do is act like he’s already passed by you, which means: act casual.
There are a couple of things that can help you with that, and although I can’t offer you a 100% success rate I have to say I’ve only been asked once for a ticket ever since I started doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;21-get-comfortable&quot;&gt;2.1. Get comfortable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first thing you should be doing when you sit down. If you have the space and the train isn’t super busy (don’t be that dick that occupies a seat with his backpack when there are people standing) take your backpack off. Maybe put it in the seat next to you or on the ground. Take off your jacket and slightly slouch on the chair. Just do everything that you would after arriving to your couch at home from a tiring night out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-dont-stare&quot;&gt;2.2. Don’t stare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don’t stare at the conductor. Just casually look at him when he enters the train car and then continue what you were doing. Or if you feel like you don’t actually know what a &lt;em&gt;“casual look”&lt;/em&gt; is, just stare at what you’re doing like it’s the most interesting thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;23-dont-stop&quot;&gt;2.3. Don’t stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What matters most is that he sees that you are busy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the most important thing is &lt;strong&gt;keep yourself busy&lt;/strong&gt;. Chances are, if your ticket had already been inspected, you would already be doing something else. So grab a book, or better yet, your computer. I mean, who’s going to take their computer out unless they had been, or expected to be, in the train for a while? And like I said, the conductor doesn’t actually memorize any faces so he’s expecting you to make the first move. If you’re busy with something else chances are, he’s not going to bother you.
Also, I wouldn’t bother wearing headphones unless you’re using them with the computer or (if you’re a multitasking master) while you read. What matters most is that he sees that you are busy, so it’s much better if your hands are doing or holding something. Oh, and forget the phone. Most people usually walk around with their phone on their hands so that won’t necessarily say &lt;em&gt;“I’m busy”&lt;/em&gt;. In this day and age it will just say &lt;em&gt;“I’m either texting someone, checking my email or just plain bored“&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-be-a-chameleon&quot;&gt;3. Be a chameleon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cha0ticneutral.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/chameleon-500.png?w=287&amp;amp;h=265&quot; alt=&quot;Invisible&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapt. Adapt. Adapt.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot stress it enough, you have to adapt to the situation! If you catch a train that is typically for long distances you can just pretend to sleep if the conductor comes. Because, let’s face it, most people will do that. But if you’re catching a train that is for short distances, you’d be better off grabbing a book. The only time I got asked for a ticket was in a short distance train where &lt;em&gt;I actually fell asleep&lt;/em&gt; (I hate traveling in the morning). The conductor woke me up and asked me for a ticket. It’s not because people don’t sleep in short distance trains, but it’s because it isn’t as common. Which means he will see someone sleeping and notice them. And that will probably remind him that he doesn’t remember asking for your ticket. So learn from nature and be a chameleon: make yourself invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go! If you follow these tips I’m 90% sure you won’t be asked for a ticket again. But, of course, accidents happen, so be prepared to show your ticket anyway. Or, if you don’t actually have one but you have the money with you, to make up a reason as to why you didn’t buy a ticket.
Feel free to use &lt;em&gt;“I was late and didn’t have time to buy a ticket”&lt;/em&gt; (works better if the train is full) or &lt;em&gt;“My dog ate my ticket”&lt;/em&gt; (works better with a dog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know that riding without a ticket is probably illegal (it is in Portugal but check the laws in your country) and in all of these experiences I actually purchased my ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
